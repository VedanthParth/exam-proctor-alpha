The Proctoring POC Application is a web-based Proof of Concept for proctoring. It captures user video and audio, uploads recordings to an Express.js backend, and generates transcripts. This POC establishes the core pipeline for media capture, storage, and speech-to-text, serving as a solid base for future enhancements in online exam monitoring.
