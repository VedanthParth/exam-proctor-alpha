Proctoring POC Application
The Proctoring POC Application is a web-based Proof of Concept for proctoring. It captures user video and audio, uploads recordings to an Express.js backend, and generates transcripts. This POC establishes the core pipeline for media capture, storage, and speech-to-text, serving as a solid base for future enhancements in online exam monitoring.

✨ Features
🎥 Live Video & Audio Capture: Utilizes the browser's MediaDevices API to access and display the user's camera and microphone feed.

⏺️ Recording Functionality: Allows users to start and stop recording their video and audio sessions.

⬆️ Media Upload: Recorded media blobs are efficiently sent to the Express.js backend.

💾 Backend Media Storage: The Express.js server receives and temporarily stores the recorded video/audio files.

📝 Audio Transcription (Simulated): A backend endpoint is ready to integrate with a Speech-to-Text (STT) service to convert recorded audio into text transcripts. (Currently simulated for POC purposes).

👁️ Transcript Display: The generated transcript (or simulated text) is displayed on the frontend after processing.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend (Next.js)
Next.js: React framework for building server-rendered and static web applications.

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

MediaRecorder API: Browser API for recording media.

fetch API: For making HTTP requests to the backend.

Backend (Express.js)
Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.

Multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for file uploads.

CORS: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

🚀 Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm, yarn, or pnpm (pnpm is used in examples)

Git

Steps:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/proctoring-poc-app.git
cd proctoring-poc-app
Install Backend Dependencies:

Bash

cd backend
pnpm install # or npm install / yarn install
Install Frontend Dependencies:

Bash

cd ../frontend
pnpm install # or npm install / yarn install
▶️ Running the Application
Start the Backend Server:
Open a new terminal, navigate to the backend directory, and run:

Bash

cd backend
pnpm run dev # If using ts-node-dev for development, otherwise:
              # pnpm run start (for compiled JS)
The backend server will typically run on http://localhost:5000 (or your configured port).

Start the Frontend Development Server:
Open another terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and run:

Bash

cd frontend
pnpm run dev # or npm run dev / yarn dev
The Next.js application will usually start on http://localhost:3000.

🧑‍💻 How to Use
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Grant Camera/Microphone Access: Your browser will prompt you to allow access to your camera and microphone. Please grant permission.

Start Recording: Click the "Start Recording" button. You should see your live video feed.

Stop Recording: Click the "Stop Recording" button. The recorded media will be uploaded to the backend.

View Transcript: After the upload and (simulated) transcription process completes, the transcript will appear on the screen.

🔮 Future Enhancements
This POC serves as a strong foundation. Here are some potential future enhancements:

Real-time Transcription: Integrate with a robust cloud-based Speech-to-Text API (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe, AssemblyAI) for accurate, real-time or near-real-time transcription.

Proctoring Analytics: Implement AI/ML models for gaze detection, object detection, anomaly detection, and sentiment analysis on the recorded data and transcripts.

Database Integration: Store recordings, transcripts, and proctoring events in a persistent database.

User Authentication & Authorization: Implement secure login and role-based access control.

Robust Error Handling & Logging: Comprehensive error handling and server-side logging.

Scalable Media Storage: Utilize cloud storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for managing recorded media.

Real-time Communication: Integrate WebSockets for real-time proctor alerts or chat features.

Improved UI/UX: Enhance the user interface for a more polished and intuitive experience.
